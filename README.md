# Week 6 Assignment – Joins and Relationships

This repository contains my solutions for Week 6 of the Databases module.  
The assignment focuses on working with INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, and RIGHT JOIN in the `salesdb` database.

## Files Included
- `answers.sql` – Contains all SQL queries for the assignment.

## Topics Covered
- Combining related tables using SQL JOINs.
- Retrieving data from the `employees`, `offices`, `products`, `productlines`, `customers`, and `orders` tables.
- Applying INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, and RIGHT JOIN as instructed.

All work has been completed using MySQL Workbench and the existing `salesdb` database provided in Week 2.
